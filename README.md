🔍 Always hungry for knowledge and eager to explore the latest advancements in technology. From AI to blockchain, I’m fascinated by how innovation shapes our digital landscape.

📚 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me lost in the pages of a good book or binge-watching the latest series. A firm believer in the power of storytelling and its intersection with technology.
